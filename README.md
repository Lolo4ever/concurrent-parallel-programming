# concurrent-parallel-programming
The goal of this project is to use IPC and Concurrent and parallel programming in a UNIX system with Python to simulate events happening at the same time. We'll simulate a city with a lot of home (each home being a different process) each house creates and consumes energy. There are transaction between houses to exchange Energy in case one produces too much energy and have a surplus. There are weather events that can change the house consumption and production. The price for the energy also varies.
